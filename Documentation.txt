Real-Time People Counter Documentation
Overview
This Python script performs real-time people detection, tracking, and counting using a webcam or DroidCam video stream. It leverages the YOLOv8 model for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking unique people across frames.

Features
Detects people in live video feed.

Tracks each detected person with a unique ID.

Counts the total number of unique people detected.

Switches between webcam and DroidCam source.

Toggle between windowed mode (30% screen size) and full-screen display.

Shows source information and unique IDs visually on the video.

Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

Ultralytics YOLO package (ultralytics)

DeepSORT Realtime (deep_sort_realtime)

NumPy (numpy)

Install dependencies via pip if needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python ultralytics deep_sort_realtime numpy
Configuration
DROIDCAM_URL: URL for DroidCam video stream.

WINDOW_NAME: Title of the OpenCV display window.

model = YOLO("yolov8s.pt"): Loads the pretrained YOLOv8 small model.

tracker = DeepSort(max_age=30): Initializes DeepSORT tracker with a max age for track persistence.

Key Functions
open_capture(source)
Opens the video capture device or stream.

Input: source (int for webcam index or string URL for DroidCam).

Returns: OpenCV VideoCapture object or None if failed.

set_windowed_mode()
Sets the OpenCV window to normal mode resized to 30% width and 35% height of a 1920x1080 screen.

Adjust screen_res if your screen size differs.

User Controls
s: Switch between webcam (default) and DroidCam stream.

f: Toggle fullscreen/windowed mode.

q: Quit the application.

How It Works
Opens video source (webcam or DroidCam).

Reads frames continuously.

Runs YOLOv8 detection to find bounding boxes of people.

Filters detections to only the 'person' class with confidence > 0.4.

Passes detections to DeepSORT to assign and update unique IDs.

Draws bounding boxes and IDs on the frame.

Displays total unique people detected.

Shows current video source label.

Handles user input for switching source, toggling fullscreen, or quitting.

Notes
The window size in windowed mode is fixed at 30% width and 35% height of 1920x1080 resolution. Change screen_res in set_windowed_mode() to fit your monitor.

Tracking persistence controlled by max_age=30 in DeepSort; adjust as needed for your scenario.

YOLOv8 model file yolov8s.pt must be accessible in the working directory or specify full path.
